# General idea

I want to implement the stacs as lists of integers.
Right now I think I will need:
- structure for stack as a list
- functions to sort the stack
- functions to modify the order of items on the list
- function to iterate throught a list

=> best is to really crete the functions for Libft BONUS and then re-use them here with the stack or/and stack item structure.

=> once Libft enriched for list functions I will use the Turk algorithm to sort the stacks

=> I will also need to translate each operation on the list into the operations names given in the assignment
