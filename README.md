# General idea

I want to implement the stacs as lists of integers.
Right now I think I will need:
- structure for stack as a list
- functions to sort the stack
- functions to modify the order of items on the list
- function to iterate throught a list

DONE => best is to really crete the functions for Libft BONUS and then re-use them here with the stack or/and stack item structure.

DONE => Enrich Libft with gnl and printf to handle the reading and output of your push_swap program

DONE => Copy Libft into this project and construct Makefile that will pick it up

> From subject PDF:
> - *Your projectâ€™s Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.*
> - *your Makefile must not relink*

TODO => Learn operations on **ptr...  -.-

TODO => TDD: write tests for parse_arg() function

TODO => Complete parse_arg() function as per subject requirements

TODO => Complete write_output() function as per subject requirements

TODO => once Libft enriched for list functions I will use the Turk algorithm to sort the stacks

TODO => I will also need to translate each operation on the list into the operations names given in the assignment

# Short notes on Makefiles

Knowledge used in Makefile:
For examples have a look at the actual [Makefile](Makefile) in this project.
- [The patsubst Function](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/1-124j-foundations-of-software-engineering-fall-2000/pages/lecture-notes/gnu_makefile_documentation/#TOC77)
```
$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)
```
Finds whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and replaces them with replacement. Here pattern may contain a % which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word. If replacement also contains a %, the % is replaced by the text that matched the % in pattern. % characters in patsubst function invocations can be quoted with preceding backslashes (\&grave;). Backslashes that would otherwise quote %characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote%characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting%characters go unmolested. For example, the patternthe\%weird\%pattern\&grave; has the%weird\&grave; preceding the operative %character, andpattern\&grave; following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any % character. Whitespace between words is folded into single space characters; leading and trailing whitespace is discarded. For example,
```
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)
```
produces the value x.c.o bar.o.





REMOVE wildcards from Makefiles
